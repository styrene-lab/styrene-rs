# CVE Disclosure and Response Workflow

This runbook defines the required process for vulnerability intake, triage, remediation, and
advisory publication for the SDK v2.5 platform.

## Intake and Triage

1. Validate report authenticity and affected release scope.
2. Assign severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) using CVSS guidance and operational impact.
3. Determine exploitability, required attacker position, and blast radius.
4. Record affected crates, binaries, and deployment profiles.

## Severity Classification

Minimum classification guidance:

- Critical: remote unauthenticated compromise, key exfiltration, or auth bypass.
- High: privilege escalation, replay bypass, or data integrity compromise.
- Medium: denial-of-service with clear operational impact.
- Low: defense-in-depth gaps without practical exploit path.

## Patch and Backport Process

1. Create private remediation branch and issue linkage.
2. Land fix with targeted tests and contract/schema updates if required.
3. Backport to supported maintenance/LTS branches per support policy.
4. Verify release gates (`security-review-check`, `unsafe-audit-check`, `governance-check`).

## Advisory Publication

Advisory must include:

1. CVE ID (or pending identifier note).
2. Affected versions and fixed versions.
3. Mitigation guidance when immediate upgrade is not possible.
4. Compatibility and migration impact notes.

## Post-Incident Hardening

1. Add regression tests for the vulnerable path.
2. Update threat model and security checklist evidence.
3. Record follow-up hardening tasks with owner and due date.
4. Link incident timeline in release notes for affected versions.
